# Json-gen

a web page that offers a graphical interface to build a generic object json (add / delete / change type and structure). Each key of the json-which can be nested or not, can contain an object of type (text, boolean, number, array or object). 
Every change in the built-in json is also automatically persisted locally - on the user's machine - so that the json can automatically reopen and re-issue if we leave the web page.
